My project, AI Career Advisor, is an AI-driven web application that supports both job seekers and recruiters.

For jobseekers, the idea is that they can upload their CV and the system will analyse the CV with Natural Language Processing to extract key information such as key skills, education and work experience. It will then compare that to job descriptions from the job market and give them feedback, like what roles they might fit into, what skills theyâ€™re missing and what areas they could improve in.

On the recruiter side of the applications, they will be able to upload job postings for the system to learn from and use as recommendations and also upload multiple CVs to be analysed. The AI will automatically summarize and visualise key information from each CV which are skills, experience, fit score, etc. in a dashboard with an option to shortlist that application.

The goal is to make recruitment and job seeking more transparent, ethical and data driven, by giving users useful insights into decision making.

The final deliverable will be a working prototype with a functional AI backend, a clean accessible UI and a working dashboard for data visualisation.
